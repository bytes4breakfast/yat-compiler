# Yet Another Toy Compiler (WIP)

This is a pet project that I'm building to learn about compilers. The planned goals are:

- A sort of complete, but simple language with conditional branching and loops.
- Produce MIPS assembly language that can be directly copy-pasted and run on the SPIM simulator.
- If I don't get too discouraged, a couple of optimization features.

Current version is just a parser for arithmetic expressions.
